## üöÄ Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20 or higher)
- React Native development environment
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development on macOS)

### Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

From the root of your React Native project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands:

#### Android

```bash
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```bash
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```bash
bundle exec pod install
```

For iOS development:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

## üîß Database Schema

The app uses SQLite with the following product table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  price REAL NOT NULL,
  discountPrice REAL,
  gstSlab REAL,
  quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  details TEXT,
  imageUri TEXT,
  createdAt TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updatedAt TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
